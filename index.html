                        <h1>About Me</h1>
                        <p>
                            I was born in kerala, India in 1991. I received my be degree in electronics and communication 
                            engineering in the year 2013. In the beginning when I was a kid, the subjects of maths and 
                            physics have always fascinated me. As I progressed through school I found I was much 
                            more interested in the application of the theory and rather than the theory itself and this is 
                            the reason behind my engineering. I also had interest in doing advance studies in computer 
                            application and networking and so im pursuing my masters in information technology in 
                            Charles Sturt University Melbourne, Australia.

                            Apart from my academic, I always been interested in photography. It was just an interest 
                            in the beginning and then it became my passion. I found my first love for photography on a 
                            family holiday to africa. For me, photography is about the concept ,the reasoning behind the 
                            image is far more than the aesthetic value. Having the passion for photography is the only
                            reason which took me half way across the country to where I reside now from where I grew
                            up.
